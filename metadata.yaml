  A charm to automatically sync Kubeflow Profiles from information a GitHub repository.

  This charm is responsible for monitoring a file from a GitHub repo that represents
  which Profiles and Contributors should exist in a cluster. Then, via a reconciliation loop
  the charm will update the Profiles and RoleBindings and AuthorizationPolicies in the
  cluster to align with this representation.

  It is useful for cluster administrators who want to automatically update
  the profiles on the cluster, based on a single source of truth.
