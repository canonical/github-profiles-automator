"""Module responsible for creating and updating Profiles based on a PMR.

This module includes both
1. the high level functions for updating/creating Profiles based on a PM
2. helpers that will handle the different phases of the above logic

The main function exposed is the create_or_update_profile(pmr), which
will run an update on the whole cluster's Profiles anad Contributors
based on a PMR.
